## L2 Rollup setup

This document guides you through the process of setting up an Arcology development network as an Ethereum L2 rollup. The network is configured for use as a single node and is intended solely for testing and development purposes.

The package contains the following major components:

- An Ethereum L1 
- An Optimism bridge
- An Arcology parallel execution node

### 1. Overview

### 2. Deployment Options

The networks can either be deployed in docker containers or on local machines. Please refer to the following 
sections for detailed instructions:

- [Docker containers](./l2-docker.md)
- [Local Deployment](./l2-local.md)

#### 2.1. Start Ethereum L1

The Ethereum L1 needs to be set up first. Execute the following commands the **first machine** where the L1 is going to run.

```shell
    docker run -itd --name ethv1 -p 7545:7545 arcologynetwork/ethereum:2.0.0    
```

#### 2.2. Start Arcology as L2

Now move on to the **second machine** to start the L2 network. Assuming the first machine's IP is `192.168.1.107` and the second is `192.168.1.69`.

```shell
docker run -itd --name l2 -p 8545:8545 arcologynetwork/devnet:2.0.0 -f http://192.168.1.69:7545 -s http://192.168.1.69:8545 -r false
```

### 3. Monitoring Status(optional)

At this point, the L1 and L2 networks are up and running. We need to check the network status to ensure it is running properly. On the machine that is running the L2 network, assuming the IP address is `192.168.1.108`.

If you are using the docker deployment, log in to the container first:
```shell
    devnet> docker exec -it l2 /bin/bash
```

Then run the following command to check the network status:
```shell
    devnet> cd op/sdk/node_modules/@arcologynetwork/frontend-tools
    devnet> nodejs tools/network-monitor.js http://192.168.174.132:8545
```

You should be able to see the the network producing empty blocks, similar to the following:

### 4. Interacting with the Network

Once the network is up and running, you can interact with it using the SDK. Please refer to the [SDK documentation](../op/sdk/README.md) for more information on how to interact with the networks.
