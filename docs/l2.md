# L2 Rollup setup

This document guides you through the process of setting up an Arcology development network as an Ethereum L2 rollup. The network is configured for use as a single node and is intended solely for testing and development purposes.


The package contains the following major components:

- An Ethereum L1 
- An Optimism bridge
- An Arcology parallel execution node

## Before You Begin

You will also need to have **two machines**, either physical or virtual, to run the development network. One machine will be used to run the L1 and the other will be used to run the Arcology parallel execution node and Optimism bridge,. The two machines must be able to communicate with each other over the network.

- **Machine 1:** Ethereum L1  
- **Machine 2:** Optimism bridge and Arcology parallel execution node

## Install the Dependencies

In the devnet directy run the following command to download the dependencies:

```shell
    > cd devnet
    devnet> ./cli/download.sh -v 2.0.0
```

The script will place the following files in the directory:

- devnet/arcology/bin/arcology
- devnet/ethereum/geth
- devnet/op/bin/op-batcher
- devnet/op/bin/op-proposer
- devnet/op/bin/op-node

>> You can also compile the source code yourself and place it in the specified directory. 

## Deployment Options

The networks can either be deployed in docker containers or on local machines. Please refer to the following 
sections for detailed instructions:

- [Docker containers](./l2-docker.md)
- [Local Deployment](./l2-local.md)

## Network Status

On the machine that is running the L2 network, assuming the IP address is `192.168.1.108`, run the following command to check the network status:

```shell
    devnet> cd op/sdk/node_modules/@arcologynetwork/frontend-tools
    devnet> nodejs tools/network-monitor.js http://192.168.1.108:8545
```

If you are using the docker deployment, log in to the container first before running the commands above:

```shell
    devnet> docker exec -it l2 /bin/bash
```
